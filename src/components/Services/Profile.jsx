                Our structural roofing services include designing and installing the tensile canopies, shade structures and lightweight structures that integrate seamlessly into modern architecture. Our form-found structures are crafted using high-tensile strength fabrics and fire-retardant fabrics that ensure safety and durability. We work with high-quality materials like ETFE and PTFE. Our structure design was inspired by Frei Otto, who is known as the father of tensile structure. Inbuilt Infraâ€™s tensile roofing service includes car parking shed, stadium roofs, event venues, airports, sport complexes, public spaces, shopping centers, temporary structures, pool enclosures and front of commercial buildings. Tensile roof is a cable-supported roof delivering a unique aesthetic look for outdoors. Our quick installation processes are complemented by detailed tensile stress analysis and advanced form finding techniques. We have a management team with expertise in supervision and guidance, which encourages a culture of team building.
